## 1. Project Overview
The Movie Ratings & Recommendation System project aims to analyze user ratings of movies to uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in viewing behavior. The goal is to design a system that can provide personalized movie recommendations based on past ratings and user similarities. The project focuses on data analysis and machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights from a movie ratings dataset.

## 3. Problem Statement
With the increasing number of movies and streaming platforms, users often struggle to discover content that suits their preferences. Manual selection can be time-consuming and inefficient. This project addresses the challenge by analyzing historical movie ratings and providing personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement.

---

## 4. Project Objectives
- To collect or simulate a dataset of movie ratings and user interactions  
- To analyze user preferences and trends in movie ratings  
- To develop a recommendation system using machine learning techniques  
- To evaluate the performance of the recommendation model  
- To document insights and potential improvements for real-world application

---

## 5. Dataset Information
- **Source:** Public movie ratings datasets (e.g., MovieLens) or simulated dataset  
- **Content:** User IDs, Movie IDs, Ratings (1–5), Genres, Timestamps  
- **Size:** Approximately 1000–5000 records (for academic purposes)  
- **Usage:** Data will be used for analysis, visualization, and building recommendation models

---

## 6. Data Preparation
- Data cleaning: remove duplicates, handle missing values  
- Feature extraction: transform categorical data (genres) into suitable format  
- Aggregation: calculate average ratings, frequency of interactions  
- Splitting: separate data into training and testing sets for ML models

---

## 7. Data Analysis Tasks
- Descriptive statistics: distribution of ratings, top-rated movies  
- User behavior analysis: average ratings per user, active users  
- Genre analysis: popular genres, trends over time  
- Correlation analysis: similarity between users and movies  

---

## 8. Key Findings and Insights
*(To be filled after data analysis)*
- Example: Most popular genres, top-rated movies, clusters of similar users, patterns in user ratings

## 9. Project Timeline

| Week | Activity |
|-----|---------|
| Week 1 | Project planning and dataset selection |
| Week 2 | Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis |
| Week 3 | Building recommendation algorithms and ML models |
| Week 4 | Model evaluation, insights extraction, visualization |
| Week 5 | Documentation, final report preparation, submission |

---

## 10. Expected Outcomes
- An organized analysis of movie ratings  
- A working recommendation algorithm (proof-of-concept)  
- Visualizations and insights into user preferences  
- Comprehensive project documentation

---

## 11. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data analytics and machine learning to solve a real-world problem of personalized movie recommendations. By following a structured approach, the project will provide actionable insights and a functional recommendation model.
